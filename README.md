# Unexpected behavior and crashes in expo-web-browser

This repository demonstrates a bug in expo-web-browser where the openBrowserAsync function can behave unexpectedly and/or crash. The issue may occur when the function resolves with an unexpected value or fails to open the URL at all. The result object may not contain the expected keys, or an error might be thrown if the URL is invalid or inaccessible.  Different browsers or versions might also contribute to the problem.

## Bug Report

The provided code snippet uses expo-web-browser to open a URL in the user's default browser. However, in some cases, this might lead to unexpected behavior or app crashes.  The solution provided addresses these issues by implementing error handling and input validation.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates improved error handling and input validation to mitigate the unexpected behavior and crashes.  It includes checks to validate the URL and handle potential errors during the browser opening process.  More robust error messages are provided to assist in debugging.
