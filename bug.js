import * as WebBrowser from 'expo-web-browser';

async function handlePress(url) {
  let result = await WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync(url);
  console.log({ result });
}

This code snippet uses expo-web-browser to open a URL in the user's default browser. However, in some cases it might cause unexpected behavior or crash, because the openBrowserAsync function can resolve with an unexpected value or even fail to open the URL at all.
The result object may not contain the expected keys, or it might throw an error if the URL is invalid or inaccessible. Also there might be issues with different browsers or versions.
